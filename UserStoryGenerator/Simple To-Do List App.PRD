Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a Simple To-Do List App

1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a Simple To-Do List Application. The primary goal of this application is to provide users with an easy and intuitive way to manage their daily tasks, helping them stay organized and productive. It aims to solve the problem of forgetting tasks and lacking a centralized place to keep track of personal and professional obligations.

2. Goals
Increase User Productivity: Provide a tool that helps users efficiently manage and complete their tasks.

Simplicity and Ease of Use: Ensure the application is straightforward to learn and use, even for non-technical users.

Reliability: Ensure tasks are saved persistently and are always accessible.

Accessibility: Make the application accessible on common web browsers.

3. Target Audience
Individuals seeking a straightforward way to organize their daily tasks.

Students managing assignments and study schedules.

Small business owners or freelancers tracking client tasks and deadlines.

Anyone who prefers a digital method for task management over traditional pen-and-paper.

4. User Stories & Features
Core Features
As a user, I want to be able to add new tasks so that I can capture my obligations.

Details: A text input field and an "Add Task" button.

As a user, I want to see a list of my active tasks so that I know what I need to do.

Details: Tasks should be displayed in a clear, scrollable list.

As a user, I want to mark a task as complete so that I can track my progress.

Details: Each task item should have a checkbox or a similar clickable element to mark it complete.

As a user, I want to delete a task so that I can remove unwanted or completed items from my list.

Details: Each task item should have a delete icon/button.

As a user, I want my tasks to be saved so that I don't lose them when I close the application.

Details: Tasks should persist across browser sessions (e.g., using local storage).

Optional (Future Consideration)
As a user, I want to filter tasks (e.g., show only active, only completed).

As a user, I want to edit an existing task's description.

As a user, I want to set a due date for a task.

As a user, I want to reorder my tasks (e.g., drag and drop).

5. Technical Requirements (High-Level)
Platform: Web-based application.

Frontend Technology: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (e.g., React, Vue, or vanilla JS for simplicity).

Data Persistence: Local Storage (for simplicity) or a simple backend database (e.g., Firebase Firestore for scalability if user accounts are introduced later).

Responsive Design: The application must be usable and display correctly on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Tasks should load quickly (within 2 seconds on a typical broadband connection).

Adding, completing, or deleting tasks should have immediate visual feedback.

Usability:

Clear, intuitive user interface.

Minimal steps required to perform common actions (add, complete, delete).

Reliability:

Tasks should not be lost unexpectedly.

The application should be stable and not crash during normal use.

Security:

If user authentication is introduced later, sensitive data must be protected (not required for initial local storage version).

7. Success Metrics
Daily Active Users (DAU): Number of unique users accessing the app daily.

Task Completion Rate: Percentage of tasks marked as complete.

Retention Rate: Percentage of users returning to the app over a specified period (e.g., weekly).

Positive User Feedback: Informal feedback indicating ease of use and utility.

8. Future Considerations
User accounts and cloud synchronization.

Categorization of tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping).

Notifications/reminders for due dates.

Dark mode theme.

Integration with calendars.
